    "Magic number: If the summation of even indexed digits is equal to the summation of odd indexed digits, then the number is a magic number.\\\n",
    "Now, write a Python program that will take a string of numbers where each number is separated by a comma. The program should print a tuple containing two sub-tuples, where the first sub-tuple will hold the magic numbers and the second sub-tuple will hold the non-magic numbers.\n",
